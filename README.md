# HummCommunity

In this project you find 3 repositories:

## <span style="color: green"> How to get data from GreenCityzen platform to your own application using push api </span>

In this repository you find a presentation of the push data service and a node js script to create a server.<br/>
In fact, the existing way to get your data in your application consists on using our API interface  http://humm-api-explorer.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/ with a GET request.<br/>
Today, with this new functionality you no more have to interact with our API interface, because each time your device emit a new data, our platfom will push it automatically to your application server thanks to the POST api service.

## <span style="color: green"> How to get the HummBox alert in your own CRM (trello) </span>

In this repository we propose you a recipe about getting your HummBox alert in your CRM (we took Trello as example).

## <span style="color: green"> How to interface your HummBox device with Opensensors.io Paltform </span>
