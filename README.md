In this project you find a recipe for a simple use of opensensors.io and two repositories:

NodeRed MQTT: in this repository contains a file .json which allows you to configure your node red project
              to send a mail alert if a device in a radius of 50km indicates a temperature higher than 50Â°C or any value you choose.
              

Rest API web page: in this repository you will find an html file of a web page to get your opensensors.io data using your API key
